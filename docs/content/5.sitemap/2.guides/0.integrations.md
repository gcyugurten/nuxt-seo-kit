## Nuxt Simple Robots

- [nuxt-simple-robots](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-simple-robots)

The sitemap module will automatically add the sitemap URL to the robots.txt file.

## Nuxt Content

- [@nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/)

When using `documentDriven` mode, all paths will be automatically added to the sitemap.

If you're not using `documentDriven` mode and your content paths are the same as their real paths,
you can enable `strictNuxtContentPaths`.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sitemap: {
    strictNuxtContentPaths: true
  }
})
```

This will offer the same behavior as `documentDriven` mode for the sitemap.

### Configuring Sitemap From Content

You can configure the sitemap from your content files.

```md
---
sitemap:
  lastmod: 2021-01-01
  changefreq: monthly
  priority: 0.8
---

# My Page
```

You can also disable the content from being used by passing in `sitemap: false` or `indexable: false`
